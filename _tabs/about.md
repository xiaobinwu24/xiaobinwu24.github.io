## Project Experience

### 1、Blockchain-Based Loyalty App Development
After graduation, I joined a company focused on aggregated payment solutions and contributed to the development of a blockchain-based app called Super Alliance Planet. This project utilized consortium blockchain technology to issue blockchain-based loyalty points, aiming to engage existing users and improve retention. My role primarily involved setting up the blockchain infrastructure and implementing backend business systems for the app.



### 2、SaaS Platform and Decentralized Points System
I later joined a company called JiuXi Technology, continuing my work in blockchain-related projects. One key initiative was a SaaS platform named TongDuiBa, designed to help merchants create and integrate loyalty points ecosystems into their existing applications. This platform allowed merchants to issue decentralized loyalty points to increase user engagement and retention. In addition to the SaaS system, I also developed an NFT issuance system and a decentralized wallet called AiDuiFen, which featured layered determinism. In this role, I led the technical development team, overseeing technical solutions, blockchain infrastructure setup, project progression, and cross-team communication. My responsibilities also included core code development and managing the daily operations of the technical team.


### 3、Blockchain Integration in the Financial and Insurance Sectors
As blockchain applications began to encounter limitations in real-world scenarios, I shifted to ZhongAn Insurance (https://www.zhongan.com/), a Hong Kong-listed company, to explore the potential of combining blockchain with the finance and insurance industries. At ZhongAn, as a senior developer, I participated in creating stablecoins and launched U.S. stock trading services through ZhongAn Bank. I was responsible for designing and implementing core trading logic, portfolio management, monitoring, and alert systems. Additionally, as a technical leader, I spearheaded the integration of Hong Kong’s licensed exchange HashKey with ZhongAn Bank to provide digital currency trading services. My responsibilities included technical discussions, architecture design, and core code implementation. Throughout my time at ZhongAn, I consistently achieved top performance ratings.



### 4、AI-Driven Startups
In January 2024, I became a co-founder in the AI and global app market space. As the technical leader, I have been driving the development of our projects, leading to the successful launch of five apps. My main responsibilities include defining and refining business strategies, managing project timelines, building the technical team, establishing infrastructure, and conducting AI technology research and development.



## Personal Evaluation

Once young and reckless with unrealistic ambitions, I have since become more mature and pragmatic. I strive for balanced growth in both technical expertise and business acumen while maintaining a strong self-driven mindset. I aim to create meaningful value in my life through continuous effort and dedication.
